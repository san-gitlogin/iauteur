# CLAUDE.md — read this FIRST; it replaces exploration

This repo is a video factory: JSON specs in `topics/<slug>/` → Remotion renders them. You (Claude) write specs and run scripts. You NEVER hand-edit component code during video production, never hand-write derived files, never overwrite an existing topic.

## Map
- `topics/<slug>/long.json + shorts.json` — one folder per video topic, IMMUTABLE once rendered. Outputs land in `topics/<slug>/out/`.
- `src/scenes/` components · `src/themes.ts` (10 themes) · `src/ui.tsx` primitives · `src/topicsIndex.ts` AUTO-GENERATED (never edit).
- `.claude/skills/tech-video-director/` — the creative law (scene library, budgets, critic checklist, design contract). 30 `design-*` skills = convertible design languages.
- `specs/gallery.json` — component showcase. `PROJECT_RULES.md` — system laws.

## Commands (use these; do not improvise)
- New topic: `npm run new-topic -- <slug> "Title"` (scaffolds folder + regenerates index; REFUSES existing slugs)
- Validate: `npm run lint` (all topics + gallery; NOTHING renders until it passes)
- Voiceover text: `npm run voiceover -- <slug>` (derived from spec — NEVER write these files yourself)
- TTS: `python scripts/voiceover.py topics/<slug>/long.json <slug>_long` then `node scripts/sync.mjs topics/<slug>/long.json out/tts/<slug>_long_timestamps.json <slug>_long`
- Preview: `npm run dev` (Studio shows `<slug>-wide-dark|wide-light|short-dark|short-light` + stills per topic)
- Proof stills: `node scripts/proof.mjs <slug>-wide-dark topics/<slug>/long.json`
- Package standalone: `npm run package -- <slug>` (self-contained dist/<slug>-video/ + zip: extract → npm install → npm run dev)
- Render: `npm run render -- <slug> wide-dark|wide-light|short-dark|short-light|thumb|cover`

## Laws (violations = defects)
1. `brand.theme` is a DARK skin — the 7 core skins are studio|neonGrid|midnight|terminal|linear|vapor|luxe, and each of the 30 design packs also has a dark theme twin (38 dark themes total; authoritative list = `DARK_THEMES` in scripts/lint-spec.mjs). Light variants render automatically (`brand.themeLight`: daylight|paper|brutalist, default daylight). The linter enforces this.
2. THEME ROTATION IS MANDATORY: before choosing, list existing `topics/*/long.json` brand.theme values; never repeat the most recent one; vary background variants too. Same-looking consecutive videos are a defect.
3. TRUTH: facts come ONLY from the user's source or live web search. Today's date comes from your environment, never from training memory. Anything time-sensitive (prices, versions, releases, "current X") without a fresh source → search the web or output `MISSING: <fact>`. Inventing stats, quotes, or dates is the worst possible failure.
4. Stage gates survive interruptions: if the user asked for Stage 1 only, session limits or "continue" do NOT authorize later stages — re-confirm.
5. Budgets are counted, not estimated. The linter is the judge; fix specs, never rules.
6. DESIGN PACKS: real visual variety comes from packs (src/designs/<pack>/ — different layouts/shapes/motion), selected via brand.design; themes only reskin. Building a pack = a dedicated approved job from a design-* skill; NEVER during video production.
7. Component/theme changes follow the skill's design_contract.md (Three Guards, ×scale, both-aspect proofs) and require explicit user approval. Building or fixing a scene component is a defined job: follow `.claude/skills/tech-video-director/references/component_authoring.md` (the six wiring files, theme-token adaptation across all 30 designs, the render-proof loop, and the paid-for lessons). Never hardcode colours/fonts/radii/px — read theme tokens so every one of the 30 designs reskins the component automatically; add each new component to `src/showcaseSpec.ts` so it appears in every design composition for review.
